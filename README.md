# Job Search App â€“ Backend API (Node.js + GraphQL + REST)

Hi! Iâ€™m excited to share this backend application that powers a job search platform using both REST and GraphQL APIs. This project brings together clean backend architecture, modular routing, admin control logic, and a flexible GraphQL schema to allow easy extension and management.

## ðŸ§© What This Project Delivers

Over the course of building this, I focused on creating a backend that is both practical and easy to work with. It includes:

- A GraphQL schema to handle admin-level actions like approving or banning users and companies
- RESTful endpoints for job posting, user management, and company logic
- A dedicated GraphQL Playground for quick testing and prototyping
- Full support for global error handling and 404 routing
- Cron job automation on app boot
- MongoDB connection setup out of the box

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The app bootstraps Express and binds all route handlers for:
- `/auth` â€“ authentication and session logic
- `/user` â€“ user profile and data routes
- `/company` â€“ company registration and admin functions
- `/job` â€“ job creation, search, and filtering

It also includes:
- `/graphQL` â€“ the main GraphQL endpoint
- `/graphPlayGround` â€“ a live playground to test queries and mutations

All routes are JSON-ready via `express.json()`, and uncaught requests are caught by a custom global error handler.
